   cd w207-predictive-maintenance

2. Python 3.12 venv + exact dependencies from lock Macs we recommend you use acceleration **
   uv venv --python 3.12
   uv sync --frozen               # add: --extra mac-accel  (Apple Silicon GPU)

3. (optional) Jupyter kernel **
   uv run python -m ipykernel install --user --name 207-pm --display-name "Python 3.12 (207-pm)"

4. Install LFS
   git lfs install
   git lfs pull

Project Proposal: Predicting Failure of Milling Machine

Motivation:

The practice of forecasting machinery failure is formally known as predictive maintenance or sometimes called damage propagation modeling. Historically, maintenance strategies have relied on scheduled servicing or reactive repairs after a breakdown. Now however, sectors like big industry, manufacturing, and healthcare leverage preventive maintenance to reduce downtime, optimize spare parts management, and to dramatically improve the accuracy of identifying failing machinery components. Being able to accurately predict equipment failure can increase the useful life of a machine or component while also maximizing uptime. In addition to lower operational costs, predictive maintenance has a significant benefit in helping to ensure human safety.
